Task 1 :

Titanic Survival Prediction:

This project aims to build a predictive model to determine whether a passenger on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, ticket class, fare, cabin, etc. The dataset used for this project is a classic beginner dataset widely available in machine learning repositories.

Task2:

Movie Rating Prediction with Python

The Movie Rating Prediction project involves building a model to predict the rating of a movie based on various features, such as genre, director, and actors. This project utilizes regression techniques to analyze historical movie data and develop a model that accurately estimates the rating assigned by users or critics. Through this project, one can gain insights into data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning modeling techniques, while exploring the factors influencing movie ratings.

Task3:

Iris Flower Classification

The Iris Flower Classification project involves developing a machine learning model to classify Iris flowers into three species: setosa, versicolor, and virginica. The classification is based on measurements of the sepal and petal. The Iris dataset is a popular choice for introductory classification tasks and serves as a foundational project for understanding machine learning classification techniques.

Task4:

Sales Prediction using Python

Sales Prediction using Python is a project focused on forecasting the amount of a product that customers will purchase. This predictive analysis involves considering various factors such as advertising expenditure, target audience segmentation, and the selection of advertising platforms. The project is designed to showcase the crucial role of a Data Scientist in businesses offering products or services, where accurate sales predictions are essential for optimizing advertising strategies and maximizing sales potential. Machine learning techniques in Python are employed to analyze and interpret data, enabling informed decision-making regarding advertising costs.

Task 5 :

Credit Card Fraud Detection

The Credit Card Fraud Detection project involves building a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The primary objectives include preprocessing and normalizing transaction data, addressing class imbalance issues, and employing classification algorithms to differentiate between genuine and fraudulent transactions. This project is crucial for financial institutions to enhance security measures and minimize the impact of fraudulent activities.
